Welcome! My name is Brian Jekel. I am a self-taught developer currently residing in Little Rock, AR. With the help of many affordable--sometimes free--resources including [The Self-Taught Programmer](https://www.theselftaughtprogrammer.io/), [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/), [David Malan's CS50](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science), and most essentially [Lane Wagner and the boot.dev team](https://www.boot.dev), I have developed a robust full-stack skill set. So far, I have used that skill set for [personal](https://github.com/bdjekel) and [freelance](https://www.blackdiamondpropertygrp.com/) projects. If you would like more detail, you can either [contact me directly](mailto:bdjekel@gmail.com?subject=Portfolio%20Site%20Interest) or view my resume / CV [here](/static/resume.pdf).
